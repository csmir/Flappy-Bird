# Flappy-Bird

This is a flappy bird clone intended as a project for the game development optional course. 

*All rights to this game belong to the rightful owners, and this project is non-fungible.*

## How to play

When the game loads, it will automatically start playing. Try to maneuver through the pipes without hitting them to score points, by managing your jumps with spacebar or LMB. Try to get the maximum amount of points possible!

## Documentation

The documentation is available in code, as the whole process is documented.
