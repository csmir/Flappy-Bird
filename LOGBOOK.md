# [DAY 1] January 31

## The initial setup

A license has been created for development independence. 
I do not own rights to this game, so it is important to properly license it as non owned. GNUv3 has been added.

## Assets

The asset import is particularly useful and helped me through most of the asset configuration. 
Outlining different assets was easy enough, and spriting and animating them was fairly straight forward. 
There are several assets I am not sure if I will actually use, considering they are for features that I dont really know how to implement. 
Some of these features are changing the pipe design and changing bird skins.

## Movement & Mechanics

A majority of the game mechanics have already been finished. 
Movable pipes and the bird movement have been implemented, with some help from a third party video. 
The suggestions were vague, so I had to figure out a great deal myself.

Scripting was easy enough, given plenty of experience in C# already.
Some of the things regarding components did not quite make sense to me but the documentation on them was clear enough for me to figure it out.

## Putting it all together

The first working prototype is now live. Some bugs are appearing which I have no idea on how to fix. 
Google/SOF is not very clear either, so I will have to wait for a while to figure it out, probably requesting some feedback from the teacher in this department.

## Get better at naming

Starting off, a lot of the naming was messy and non sensical. 
I have reformatted the project to have better naming, as well as put myself to give things better names in the future.

## Bug fixes

Today, I have figured out what was messing with the code, it being unable to continue playing after the first round. 
This was because it was never able to change the frames back to a higher number after reset, as it froze the code before being able to continue.

## Readme

The readme needed some updates, primarily to credit the assets as well as documentation of the code. 
A simple line of text has also been added that explains how to play.

## Code documentation

The code needed some documenting which I have gone through and done. 
Code documentation is really straight forward, so this was a 5 minute task.

# [Day 4] March 2

## Finalizing

Today it was time to finalize. Some things have been forgotten to be added, such as the log book and transfer assets. These are now all added.
