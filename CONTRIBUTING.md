# Contributing Guidelines

This project has been started by me, but there may be cases where I will fall out, either by lack of motivation or lack of ability to. 
For this reason, this document will introduce the projects' current state and what to do with it in the future.

## To Do

What is left to do for the game to be complete? How can you, or we, wrap this up?

### Variation in pipe sequence

The pipes currently spawn at an equal width of eachother, at the same tempo and having the same sprite. 
It would be good to mix this up, giving the pipes different tempos and spacing between eachother.

### Skins

Players would be able to unlock skins as they play more, 
which have a different design and potentially even abilities?

### Leaderboard

A global leaderboard to show who has performed the best out of all players in the world would be a lot of fun. 
This is a rewarding feature that will allow players to play with a goal in mind.

## IDE / Code environment

### Coding

It is suggested to develop the scripts in Visual Studio 2022, as this is what I have used as well. 
Unity has native support for this, if you install the unity development tools through Visual Studio Version Manager.

### Running & Building

The version of Unity I used to build and test the game is 2021.3.17f1 for Windows. 
If you find the assembly does not open on later versions, it is suggested to revert to this one and try again.
